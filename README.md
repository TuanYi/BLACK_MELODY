## About
This is a project aiming to collect stellar-mass black holes (BH) measured by dynamical method.
We have currently collected seven targets discovered in recent years 
and hopefully the number will boost in a few years.
To construct and study an unbiased mass distribution of Galactic stellar-mass BHs, 
one has to build a decent catalog of BHs discovered by different methods.
Notably, [BlackCat](https://www.astro.puc.cl/BlackCAT/index.php) is 
"a thorough and comprehensive catalogue containing the most updated information about 
stellar-mass black holes (BHs), mainly focused in systems detected as X-ray transients."
Our project is inspired by the fantastic work of 
[Corral-Santana et al. 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...587A..61C/abstract),
but focus on the dynamically discovered, X-ray quiet (or non-accreting) black holes.

## A Baby Catalog 
Here are seven BHs collected so far: 
*MW C656: [Casares et al. 2014](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014Natur.505..378C/abstract); A Be-type star with a black-hole companion
*LB-1: [Liu et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019Natur.575..618L/abstract); A wide star-black-hole binary system from radial-velocity measurements
*[Thompson et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019Sci...366..637T/abstract); A noninteracting low-mass black holeâ€“giant star binary system

Athough some of them still has controversy in the community of astronomy,
many are great systems that definitely worth of take a good study at.
