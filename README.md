## About
This is a project aiming to collect stellar-mass black holes (BH) measured by dynamical method.
We have currently collected seven targets discovered in recent years 
and hopefully the number will boost in a few years.
To constrcut and study an unbiased mass distribution of Galactic stellar-mass BHs, 
one has to build a decent catalog of BHs discovered by different methods.
Notably, [BlackCat](https://www.astro.puc.cl/BlackCAT/index.php) is 
"a thorough and comprehensive catalogue containing the most updated information about 
stellar-mass black holes (BHs), mainly focused in systems detected as X-ray transients."
Our project is inspired by the fantastic work of 
[Corral-Santana et al. 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...587A..61C/abstract),
but focus on the dynamically discovered, X-ray quiet (or non-accreting) black holes.

## The "Baby" Catalog 
Here are seven BHs collected so far: . 
Athough some of them still has controversy in the community of astronomy,
many are great systems that definitely worth of take a good study at.
