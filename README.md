## About
This is a project aiming to collect stellar-mass black holes (BH) measured by the dynamical method.
We have currently collected seven targets discovered in recent years 
and hopefully, the number will boost in a near future.
To construct and study an unbiased mass distribution of Galactic stellar-mass BHs, 
one has to build a decent catalog of BHs discovered by different methods.
Notably, [BlackCat](https://www.astro.puc.cl/BlackCAT/index.php) is 
"a thorough and comprehensive catalogue containing the most updated information about 
stellar-mass black holes (BHs), mainly focused in systems detected as X-ray transients."
Our project is inspired by the fantastic work of 
[Corral-Santana et al. 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...587A..61C/abstract),
but focuses on the dynamically discovered, X-ray quiet (or non-accreting) black holes.
If I missed your dynamically discovered BH(s), please let me know immediately. Apologize for my ignorance!

## Catalog Today
Here are seven BHs collected so far: 
* MW C656: [Casares et al. 2014](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014Natur.505..378C/abstract); A Be-type star with a black-hole companion
* LB-1: [Liu et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019Natur.575..618L/abstract); A wide star-black-hole binary system from radial-velocity measurements <br>
  and [Liu et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...900...42L/abstract); Phase-dependent Study of Near-infrared Disk Emission Lines in LB-1
* 2MASS J05215658+4359220: [Thompson et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019Sci...366..637T/abstract); A noninteracting low-mass black hole–giant star binary system
* HR 6819: [Rivinius et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...637L...3R/abstract); A naked-eye triple system with a nonaccreting black hole in the inner binary
* V723 Mon: [Jayasinghe et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.2577J/abstract); A unicorn in monoceros: the 3 M⊙ dark companion to the bright, nearby red giant V723 Mon is a non-interacting, mass-gap black hole candidate
* NGC 1850 BH1: [Saracino et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.tmp.2924S/abstract); A black hole detected in the young massive LMC cluster NGC 1850
* NGC2004#115: [Lennon et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv211112173L/abstract); The VLT-FLAMES survey of massive stars. NGC2004#115: A triple system hosting a possible short period B+BH binary

Note that some of them are candidates, great discussions on these systems have been carried out.
See [this ads library](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/libraries/iUrTvxAJRT6IfZp5d-Mt9Q) for papers that discuss these systems. 
Surely, to discover and confirm a BH is not a trivial task, but that is all the fun in it!
